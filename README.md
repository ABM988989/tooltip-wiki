# Tooltip Wiki

**Tooltip Wiki** is a **WordPress plugin**, for displaying a pop-up tooltip on internal links to other blog posts.

The plugin is called Tooltip Wiki, because the idea was taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation_popups).

In order for the plugin to work properly, it is **important** to first check the PHP and JS files, and make changes, for it to work on your WordPress theme.

The plugin is still in development. So that it has all the limitations.
The plugin was developed by a beginner developer, so it is not the most perfect.
If you want to continue developing it, we will be very grateful to you.
